# VDerive-Assignment
Consider a scenario where we are trying to identify if there was an attack done by 
someone or it was an accident hit. Going through the above link at time 08:35:32 
, Is it possible to identify the point of impact and angle of impact ? If possible, 
How ?

For this research, I compared the accuracy of the "Classification Using Transfer 
Learning" and "Classification Using CNN From Scratch" image classification 
techniques. I've shared my findings with you. And to grasp the entire scenario, I use the 
Kaggle dataset, which is not the precise dataset of "attack" and "accident," but it is 
similar.
I appreciate you giving me this assignment because it teaches me a lot. I've finished 
the training and detection, which I've shared with you. I'll try to finish the remaining 
portion, after which I'll share it with you again
